            <h2>Point-to-Point Topology</h2>
            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>A direct connection between two devices. Only those two devices are involved, and the communication is private.</p>

            <div class="analogy">
                <h4>Analogy:</h4>
                <p>Like a private phone call between two people — no one else can hear the conversation.</p>

            <h3>When it's used:</h3>

                <p>Like a classroom where the teacher (in the center) communicates individually with each student.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>When it's used:</h3>

            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>All devices share a single central cable (called a backbone) for communication. Messages are broadcast to all devices.</p>

            <h3>What it is:</h3>

            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>A combination of two or more different topologies. For example, a large network might use star topology in each room and connect those rooms using a ring or bus.</p>

            <div class="analogy">
                <h4>Analogy:</h4>

            </div>

            <h3>When it's used:</h3>

                <h3>🏢 Intranet</h3>
                <p>A mini-internet for internal use in an organization. Think private company portals.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🔒 Only employees or members can access it — secure and isolated.</li>
                    <li>📁 Used to share internal documents, HR forms, announcements, etc.</li>
                    <li>🧠 Managed by: The organization's internal IT team.</li>
                    <li>💡 Often runs on the same technology as the internet but with tighter security and limited access.</li>

                <h3>🔁 Repeater</h3>
                <div class="device-content">
                    <h4>What it does:</h4>
                    <p>A repeater takes a weak or fading signal and boosts it so it can keep traveling farther.</p>

                    <div class="analogy">
                        <h4>Think of it like this:</h4>
                        <p>You're yelling across a canyon. Your voice starts to fade, but someone in the middle repeats it loudly, helping your message reach the other side.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Where it's used:</h4>
                    <p>Used to extend network range, especially in long-distance wired or wireless connections — like in large buildings or across campuses.</p>

                    <div class="status current">✅ Still useful in certain network setups and long-range communication. But their role is more limited compared to the past.</div>

                <h3>📢 Hub</h3>
                <div class="device-content">
                    <h4>What it does:</h4>
                    <p>A hub connects several devices and sends the same message to all of them — whether they need it or not.</p>

                    <div class="analogy">
                        <h4>Think of it like this:</h4>
                        <p>It's like shouting an announcement in a crowded room — everyone hears it, even if it's not meant for them.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Why it's outdated:</h4>
                    <p>Hubs are simple and cheap, but not smart. They create lots of "noise" and slow things down.</p>

                    <div class="status outdated">❌ Rarely used today — replaced by smarter devices like switches.</div>

                <h3>🌉 Bridge</h3>
                <div class="device-content">
                    <h4>What it does:</h4>
                    <p>A bridge connects two similar networks and manages traffic between them. It helps reduce congestion and organizes data flow.</p>

                    <div class="analogy">
                        <h4>Think of it like this:</h4>
                        <p>Two neighborhoods want to visit each other, but there's a river in between. A bridge lets them cross easily without getting lost.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>When it's used:</h4>
                    <p>Still relevant in some cases, especially in older or segmented networks.</p>

                    <div class="status current">✅ Useful when combining or isolating parts of a LAN.</div>

                <h3>🔀 Switch</h3>
                <div class="device-content">
                    <h4>What it does:</h4>
                    <p>A switch connects devices like computers and printers, but unlike a hub, it sends data only to the intended device.</p>

                    <div class="analogy">
                        <h4>Think of it like this:</h4>
                        <p>Imagine a mail carrier delivering letters only to the right address — not dumping everyone's mail in the same box.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Why it's awesome:</h4>
                    <p>Fast, secure, and efficient. Switches are the backbone of modern LANs.</p>

                    <div class="status current">✅ Very common — used everywhere, from homes to large offices.</div>

                <div class="device-content">
                    <h4>What it does:</h4>
                    <p>A router connects different networks — like your home network to the internet. It figures out the best path for your data to travel.</p>

                    <div class="analogy">
                        <h4>Think of it like this:</h4>
                        <p>A router is a traffic cop at a busy intersection, directing each car (or data packet) where it needs to go based on its destination.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Bonus:</h4>
                    <p>Most home routers are all-in-one devices that also include a switch, wireless access point, and sometimes even a firewall.</p>

                    <div class="status current">✅ Essential for both home and business networks.</div>

                <div class="device-content">
                    <h4>What it does:</h4>
                    <p>A WAP lets wireless devices connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. It broadcasts a signal that your laptop, phone, or tablet can connect to.</p>

                    <div class="analogy">
                        <h4>Think of it like this:</h4>
                        <p>It's like a mini radio tower in your home or office that shouts out: "Hey! Connect to me for internet!"</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Why it's important:</h4>
                    <p>Crucial in buildings where users move around or need Wi-Fi in multiple rooms.</p>

                    <div class="status current">✅ Common in homes, cafes, airports, schools — basically everywhere you need Wi-Fi.</div>
