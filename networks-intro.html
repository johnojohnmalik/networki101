    <h1>🔌 Start Here: Welcome to the World of Networks</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
      <p>🌍 The Internet connects us all — but do you understand how?</p>
      <p>Every time you send a WhatsApp message, open Instagram, or stream a video — you're using a network.</p>
      <p>But do you know what's happening behind the scenes?</p>
      
      <p>If you've ever wondered how data travels, what an IP address does, or what routers actually do — you're in the right place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>🚨 Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>Whether you dream of working in cybersecurity, want to understand the digital world better, or just upgrade your skills — this is where it all begins.</p>
      
      <p>Every cyberattack, every secure app, every online service — it all runs on networking foundations.</p>
      <p>If you don't understand how networks work, you're missing the whole picture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning cybersecurity without networking is like trying to drive without knowing what brakes are.</p>

      <h2>Real World Cyber Stories That Shocked the World:</h2>

      <div class="story-box">
        <h3>🧨 STUXNET (2010)</h3>
        <p>It looked like just another worm.</p>
        <p>But under the hood, it was military-grade sabotage, written by elite intelligence agencies — and it had one target: Iran's nuclear program.</p>
        <p>Stuxnet silently infiltrated computers through USB drives.</p>
        <p>It didn't just spy or steal. It attacked the industrial control systems that ran uranium-enriching centrifuges at Natanz.</p>
        <p>It spun them too fast, too slow, then back again — breaking them down while lying to engineers with fake sensor data.</p>
        <p>They saw normal readings. Meanwhile, the machines were self-destructing.</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>☠️ Over 1,000 centrifuges destroyed.</li>
          <li>⚔️ This was the first cyber attack to cause real-world physical destruction.</li>
          <li>👁️ Believed to be a joint operation between the U.S. and Israel — but never officially confirmed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>💥 The age of digital warfare began with a silent line of code.</p>

        <h3>🏥 WannaCry: Hospitals Held Hostage (2017)</h3>
        <p>It spread like wildfire across the globe in just hours.</p>
        <p>A weaponized Windows exploit — stolen from the NSA — was turned into a ransomware worm by shadowy hackers known as the Lazarus Group (linked to North Korea).</p>
        <p>WannaCry didn't knock on doors. It kicked them in.</p>
        <p>It encrypted everything on infected computers and demanded payment in Bitcoin.</p>
        <p>In the UK alone, the National Health Service (NHS) was devastated:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Ambulances rerouted</li>
          <li>Surgeries canceled</li>
          <li>Critical patient records locked</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In total:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>💻 200,000+ systems infected</li>
          <li>🌍 150+ countries affected</li>
          <li>🧠 Billions in damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And all from a single, unpatched vulnerability.</p>

        <h3>🛢️ Colonial Pipeline: Fuel Panic in America (2021)</h3>
        <p>One weak password. That's all it took.</p>
        <p>A group called DarkSide breached Colonial Pipeline's network using a compromised VPN login.</p>
        <p>Once inside, they encrypted critical systems and demanded ransom.</p>
        <p>Colonial — supplying nearly half the fuel to the U.S. East Coast — had no choice but to shut everything down.</p>
        <p>What followed was chaos:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>🛢️ Gas stations emptied out</li>
          <li>⛽ Long lines, hoarding, and panic buying</li>
          <li>✈️ Airlines rerouted flights due to fuel shortages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eventually, Colonial paid a $4.4 million ransom, though much of it was later recovered by the FBI.</p>
        <p>All because of one bad password and no multi-factor authentication.</p>

        <h3>🏛️ SolarWinds: A Trojan Horse in Government (2020)</h3>
        <p>It started with a software update — trusted, signed, and delivered by SolarWinds, a major IT vendor.</p>
        <p>But hidden inside that update was a backdoor, inserted by suspected Russian state hackers (known as APT29 or "Cozy Bear").</p>
        <p>This wasn't ransomware. It was espionage on a global scale:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>🕵️‍♂️ 18,000+ customers received the poisoned update</li>
          <li>🇺🇸 U.S. agencies infiltrated: Department of Homeland Security, Treasury, Commerce, and more</li>
          <li>🧪 Private companies compromised: Microsoft, FireEye, and beyond</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What made it terrifying? It went undetected for 9 months.</p>
        <p>The attackers didn't just break in — they blended in, studying systems and stealing secrets quietly.</p>
        <p>🎯 The perfect modern spy operation — launched through a trusted software update.</p>

        <h3>🧠 Cambridge Analytica: Hacked Minds, Not Machines (2018)</h3>
        <p>No firewalls were breached. No data was stolen.</p>
        <p>Instead, your own clicks, likes, and shares were used against you.</p>
        <p>Cambridge Analytica harvested Facebook data on 87 million users — without their consent.</p>
        <p>Using psychographic profiling, they served people hyper-targeted political ads that manipulated emotions and influenced voting behavior.</p>
        <p>This wasn't hacking devices.</p>
        <p>It was hacking beliefs, opinions, and democracy itself.</p>

      <h2>🌐 What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>This isn't just theory. It's interactive, visual, quiz-based learning — in plain English, especially for beginners with no prior knowledge, or for students who want to review their base knowledge.</p>
      <p>Each lesson builds step-by-step, teaching you:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>What exactly is a network? What are clients and servers?</li>
        <li>What do cables, switches, and routers do?</li>
        <li>How do computers "talk" to each other using protocols?</li>
        <li>What's the difference between internal and external IP addresses?</li>
        <li>How do models like OSI and TCP/IP work behind the scene and more!</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It all starts with the basics.</p>
      <p>And once you understand them — the entire digital world becomes visible.</p>
